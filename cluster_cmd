# The following commands can be issued fromn within python to setup a
# SSHCluster on a self-managed cluster of independent machines
#IPs, usernames, keys, etc. must be adapted

#Alternative setup with dask-ssh is also possible

#Note the first listed IP default to the location of the scheduler. By repeating
#it a worker can also be started on the scheduler node.
